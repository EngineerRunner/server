Your {{ env['EMAIL_PLATFORM_NAME'] }} account has been locked because we believe it may have been compromised. This can happen if your {{ env['EMAIL_PLATFORM_NAME'] }} password is weak, you used the same password on another website and that website was hacked, or you accidentally gave an access token to someone else.

You will be required to reset your password using this email address ({{ address }}) before logging back in to {{ env['EMAIL_PLATFORM_NAME'] }}.

If you had multi-factor authentication enabled, it has been temporarily disabled as a precaution, in case it was modified by someone attempting to lock you out of your account.

If you have any questions, please reach out to {{ env['EMAIL_PLATFORM_SUPPORT'] }}.
